# Snake Game
## Description
[Classic Snake Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) written in python. I used OOP to make my program more clear and less cluttered. Position of the food is completely random and snake increases its size after eating. There is also a scoreboard that keeps track of user's score.
## What you need to download in order for my small game to work:
- main.py
- snake.py
- food.py
- scoreboard.py
### !!! main.py is only file that you need to open to start my game
