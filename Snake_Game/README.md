# Snake Game
[Classic Snake Game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)) written in python. I used [OOP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) to make my program less cluttered. Position of the food is completely random and snake increases its size after eating. There is also a scoreboard that keeps track of user's score.
## What you need to download:
- main.py (Only file that you need to open in order to play.)
- snake.py
- food.py
- scoreboard.py
