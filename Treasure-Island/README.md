# Treasure-Island
This is a really simple game that uses "if statements in a python language".
User have a choice to choose their own path and try thier best to find a treasure!
I also used for the first time python's escape characters which allowed me to use "You're" in a sentence.
That's it, really! It's not that complicated :D
