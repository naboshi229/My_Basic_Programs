# Fizz-Buzz
Program prints in a range given by the user input. If a number that is printed out is divisible by 3 near it there is a word (Fizz), if it is divisible by 5 there is a word (Buzz), if it is by 3 and 5 there is a message (FizzBuzz).
This simple, let's call it a "game" uses while loops, try and expect statement, for loops and if and elif statements.
First while loop with try and expect (expecting an type of error ValueError) statements checks if user's input is not a word but integer number (without any fractions too).
Then while loop checks if user's input is higher and not equal to 0.
After meeting both conditions for loop then generates numbers starting from 1 to user's input.
If and elif statements check if generated number is firstly diveded by 3 and 5 if not -> elif checks if the number can be diveded by only 3 if not -> then another elif checks if the generated number can be diveded by only 5 if not -> else just prints a number without any message to it.
After exectuing everything in a for loop, program prints out a message to the user (That's everything :))
