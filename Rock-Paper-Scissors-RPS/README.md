# Rock-Paper-Scissors-RPS-
## Descritiopn
- Short an easy game of rock, paper and sicssors that I think everybody knows.
- This was my first time using modules. I divided my program into two files: main.py (which has all the lines of my code, I mean game) and ASCII_rps.py (which stores all of the ASCII character type of images, for rock, paper and sicissors).
## Quick note
- Rock-Paper-Scissors-RPS.py
- ASCII_rps.py
### These are the files you need to download in order for my program to work properly.
## What it does/inclueds?:
- It contains random intiger (short for int) number generator (I imported here random module).
- Program also checks user input in two while loops.
- "Try" block in the first while loop checks if user typed intiger number (short for int) if not it asks them to type their input again expecting type of error "Value Error".
- User also can't type the number which is not 0, 1, 2, they will need to type their number again. Typing everything correctly will break all of the while loops.
- Program prints out the choice of user in ASCII character type of image imported from another python file, same goes for computer choice.
- Then program checks the result in (if statements) and prints out the result to user containing a proper message for every case.
### I think that will be it. Can't think of more what I can put into that program for now. Thanks for reading! :>
