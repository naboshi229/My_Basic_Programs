# Rock-Paper-Scissors-RPS-
## Descritiopn
- Short an easy game of rock, paper and sicssors that I think everybody knows.
- This was my first time using modules. I divided my program into two files: main.py (which has all the lines of my code, I mean game) and ASCII_rps.py (which stores all of the ASCII character type of images, for rock, paper and sicissors).
## Quick note
- Rock-Paper-Scissors-RPS.py
- ASCII_rps.py
### These are the files you need to download in order for my program to work properly.
