# Caesar Cipher
This program encrytps or decrypts user's input using [Caesar's type of encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher). My program asks user of the number of shifts in order to encrypt / decrypt message.
## What you need to download:
- main.py
- caesar_cipher_art.py
### Every file needs to be in the same dictionary!!! Otherwise my game will not work properly!!!
